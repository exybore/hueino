## 💡 How it works

A button is controlling a RGB LED. When pushing it, it switches between written modes - different colors, and in the future multi-colors. Also, a potentiometer or any kind of variable resistor is controlling the intensity of this LED.

## 🔌 Hardware setup

You can find the hardware setup on the [image schema](docs/shema.png) or the [Fritzing schema](docs/schema.fzz).
